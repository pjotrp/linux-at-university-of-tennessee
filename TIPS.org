* Production quality images from PDF

Sometimes journals ask for production type images from a PDF (generated by LaTeX).
The trick is to keep image quality to the end. The following may work:

1. Use pdftk to select a page
2. Load the page in gimp - make sure to use 300 dpi
3. Select/cut out the image an paste it into a new image
4. Crop image to content
5. Export as tiff with LZW compression at high resolution

pdftk vcf-paper.pdf cat 7 output p7.pdf
gimp p7.pdf
#+END_SRC sh
